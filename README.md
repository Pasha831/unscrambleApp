# Unscramble

🔡Android Open Source Project

Simple game where user unscrambles words and get points!

## Updates

### v1.1.0:

* Добавлена руссфикация! 🇷🇺
* EditText was deleted, now application uses letter cards inside two Recycleriews

## What i've learned?

* How to use and implement `Fragment`s
* `Lifecycle` of both Activities and Fragments
* `ViewModel`: how to store data and not to lose it while configuration changes
* `LiveData`: how it holds data, how it uses `Observer`s to update the UI
* `DataBinding`: how to bind code to UI and vise versa!
* `Binding expressions`: how to get rid of `Observer`s in code and update the UI directly in the layout
* `Talkback`: how to spell the word character by character using `Spannable` class

## Noticeable mention

There is some knowledge that wasn't used in this project, but i've also learned it on the way:

* `Intent`s: explicit (launch another activity) and implicit (share a message) intents
* `Menu`: how to create menu and its icons at the top of the application
* `Android Jetpack Components`: `Fragment`s, `Navigation Component` (navigation graph and switching fragments)

## How it looks?
